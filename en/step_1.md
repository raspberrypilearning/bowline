## Introduction

We went through typing two ropes together with a sheetbend [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sheetbend){:target="_blank"}. In this tutorial, we'll use the same knot tied back on itself to create a secure loop that's easy to untie. 

In this configuration, it’s known as a bowline, but it’s exactly the same knot as the sheet bend. We do have to tie this knot slightly differently because one end of the rope isn’t accessible, (as it’s not an end at all but a part of the loop).

### Author
Ben has very strong opinions on knots, and people tend to avoid mentioning anything involving rope or string in his presence so they don’t get lectured in the finer points of cord typing.
